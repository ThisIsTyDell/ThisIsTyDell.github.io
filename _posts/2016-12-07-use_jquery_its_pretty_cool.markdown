So you've made your first functional web app, and you're pretty excited. You may be wondering what to do next? Should you just stop here? Should you keep building on this app? What features to add? and a list of a bunch of other questions that circle your mind. Well, might I suggest something? Add some interactivity by implementing jQuery. This post isn't a how-to, sorry there's tons of those on the net. This is a brief overview of how it can put some awesome-sauce into your application.

Using jQuery and AJAX will allow the client side of your application to send and retrieve data from the server without forcing the browser to reload. Why is this important you ask? It's important because it will optimize your overall user experience. It can lead to some pretty awesome features, but I'll just touch on the basics.

Imagine visiting one of your favorite websites...um...let's say... BookFace.com. Now think of how it works currently, fluid and intuitive right? Without the functionality that jQuery and AJAX provide we can throw all of that coolness out the window. The website would have to reload every single time you clicked "like" on someone's post or picture.

Every time you made a new post, you would have to wait yet again for the page to reload. Talk about annoying. You would probably stop using the website or app altogether and move to something much cooler. Not efficient at all.

That would suck if real life worked like that. Wake up, eat breakfast in the morning, and then have to "reload" by going back to sleep and waking up again. Or how about this, what if your cellphone restarted after every single interaction.  What a drag that would be. I'm glad the UNIVERSE doesn't work that way.

> jQuery and AJAX saved the UNIVERSE! Nah, just kidding, but it can work wonders for your web app.

Using a GET request will allow you to "get" data from the server and have it returned back to you in the form of JSON, either from the API you built, or even another popular applications API. All without refreshing the browser. Being able to do this makes using jQuery even more powerful. Instead of having to scrape a website, that may change, you can just pull data directly from their API using endpoints. Then you can do whatever you want with that data. You can display it back to the user by manipulating the DOM, build new objects with it, or use that data to affect other data in your models. So that like button you so desperately want to click can be clicked to your heart's content without refreshing the browser.

So just as with GET request in jQuery and AJAX, Using a POST request will allow you to send data to the server through params. You can take that data temporarily stored in params and persist it to your application's database. Yep, you guessed it, without even refreshing the browser. So really you could make a new post on BookFace.com and the post could be shown to you instantly without refreshing. You could also post to other applications API. You could potentially allow your app to talk to and manipulate data of other apps. Like an app where you can post once, and it will be sent out to all of your social media sites at once. LIFE HACKED!

These are just some basic functionalities of jQuery and AJAX. What are some cool features you can think of that would make use of jQuery and AJAX? Think of some the next time you sit down to work on your application.

There are lot's of resources on the net on how to implement jQuery and AJAX. Remember Google is your friend. Also if you aren't already attending a code school, I highly recommend Learn.co Happy Coding - TyDell Miller
